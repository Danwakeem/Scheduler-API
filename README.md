# Scheduler API

This is the basic API for my scheduler app I have been thinking about making.

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).

### Reservations
This is the basic reservation model that will cover most types of reservations. I have set up a `metadata` field so I can make this API more multi tenate.
